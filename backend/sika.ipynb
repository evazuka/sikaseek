They are supplied as ready-to-use solutions either in one single component or two-component packs to seal against damp soil, seepage and percolating water. In addition, cementitious waterproofing mortar can also be used for the protection of concrete structures. Waterproofing mortars are often applied in water reservoirs, water retaining structures, basements, and other engineering structures as well as beneath tiling for swimming pools, balconies, bathrooms, and kitchens.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the difference between rigid and flexible waterproofing?\\n\\n\\n\\nRigid cementitious waterproofing mortar is typically hard and non-deformable, whereas flexible cementitious waterproofing mortar is soft and deformable.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat waterproofing products shall I use for toilets, bathrooms, and kitchens?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn general, any cementitious based mortar and liquid applied bituminous coating are suitable be used for these areas. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan I apply tile adhesive directly onto the cementitious waterproofing? \\n\\n\\n\\nYes, most cementitious based tile adhesives should be able to apply directly onto the cementitious waterproofing mortar. However, please contact the manufacturer(s) to ensure the compatibility between the two products. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the bond strength of cementitious waterproofing?\\n\\n\\n\\nTypical bond strength of cementitious waterproofing mortar ranges from 0.5–1.0 N/mm², depending on the type and grade of the products. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat is the consumption of cementitious waterproofing for bathrooms, toilets, and kitchens? What is the minimum number of layers required?\\n\\n\\n\\nSika recommends a consumption rate of 1.0kg per m² per coat and a minimum of two coats are required for bathroom, toilets, and kitchen \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is an angle-fillet? What is Sika SealTape F (edge sealing tape)? And how do I decide on which one to use?\\n\\n\\n\\nAn angle fillet is incorporated at the base angle to round off the 90° right angle at the wall to floor joint to form a 45° angle. A typical angle fillet is formed using cementitious based material. Thus, it is hard and non-deformable. An edge tape is a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) that is elastic in nature. The edge tape is an elastic system component that is used in combination with Sika waterproofing mortar to form a high elastic and crack bridging sealing tape around the edge and corners. Cement sand with latex (or Sikagrout) angle-fillet is sufficient when a concrete kicker is provided. An edge tape is recommended for Drywall or Precast systems and also when a concrete kicker is not provided.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do I waterproof the downpipe area?\\n\\n\\n\\nA. To apply Sealant in the prepared groove around the circumference between the PVC pipe and the concrete slab.\\n\\nB. To apply Bituminous coating on the slab around the circumference of the PVC pipe and over the joint between the concrete and the pipe down to the internal wall of the PVC pipe.\\n\\n\\n\\nShall I lay the levelling screed below or on top of the cementitious waterproofing? \\n\\n\\n\\nCommon practice in Malaysia is:\\n\\nA. The finishing is tile, the screed is normally applied before the waterproofing.\\n\\nB. Bare concrete (without tile), the screed is normally applied after the waterproofing. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the difference between site mix and pre-bagged screed?\\n\\n\\n\\nSite mixing is done at the site by mixing cement, sand, and water with the estimated quantity of each material.  It is often not properly mixed and very inconsistent in terms of quality control.\\n\\n\\n\\nA pre-bagged screed is produced and packed in the factory with the predetermined ratio to ensure the mixing is homogeneous and the quality is controlled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do I waterproof gypsum wallboard?\\n\\n\\n\\nDue to the porosity of the gypsum surface, Sika recommends a primer coat before the application of cementitious waterproofing. SikaPrimer-11 WMY is required prior to the application of SikaTop Seal-107 (MY), SikaTopseal-109 MY and Sikalastic-1 KMY. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaterproofing swimming pools\\n\\nWhat waterproofing products shall I use for swimming pools under tiles (both floor and wall)?', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None)], metadata={'3a2c88d0-bea2-46b5-8b63-adf9175d0a8d': {'file_name': 'FAQ Waterproofing indoor wet areas  swimming pools V3_240921 (1).docx'}})"
